# iOS-Style Portfolio

A single-page portfolio that looks like an iPhone Home Screen with two widgets and an app grid.

## Structure
- `index.html` — markup
- `styles.css` — Apple-inspired styling
- `script.js` — tiny interaction (tap animation)
- `assets/` — place local images or wallpapers here (optional)

## Run
Just open `index.html` in any modern browser. No build step needed.
